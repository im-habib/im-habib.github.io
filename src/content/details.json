            "vision": "To revolutionize neurofeedback by moving from localized frequency training to dynamic, network-wide brain modulation.",
            "problem_statement": "Traditional neurofeedback is often static and ignores the complex, networked nature of brain communication, leading to slow learning curves and limited clinical efficacy.",
            "solution": "Neurasynk utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to create a 'smart' closed-loop system. It treats the brain as a dynamic graph, where an AI agent learns the most effective way to stimulate neural plasticity by adjusting feedback in real-time based on functional connectivity patterns.",
